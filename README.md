# React CV Maker

## Overview

First React project as part of the ReactJS section of The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-cv-application). The assignment was to build a web application to build CVs.

When using the app, users are prompted to enter information related to personal details, skills, work experience, education, and projects to populate their CV. On submitting, the user inputted information is used to generate a CV for the user, after which the user is free to edit and adjust as they like.

The project started to help cement a number of basic React concepts which I'd studied prior to the project including, breaking up the application into and building the various components, as well as heavy usage of props and states to hold, display, and allow the user to update personal information.

The best way to view the project is live on Github at: https://ayrt-n.github.io/cv-maker/
